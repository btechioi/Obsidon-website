## 🧾 Project Description
- This project involves creating a comprehensive system to calibrate, control, and operate a quadcopter drone made with RP2040. The system includes:
  - An Arduino-based firmware for real-time sensor reading, PID tuning, and motor control.
  - A Python-based desktop application for PID parameter calibration, manual control of the drone, and safety features like arming/disarming.
  - A robust safety mechanism to prevent accidental motor operation unless explicitly armed.
